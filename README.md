## Project Planning and Requirements Gathering:
1. Define the scope of the project.
2. Gather requirements: What functionalities should the ship management system have? User management, ship registration, maintenance tracking, crew management, scheduling, etc.
3. Design the database schema.
4. Setting Up the Development Environment:
5. Install necessary tools and libraries (Python, SSMS, etc.).
6. Create a new project directory.

## Backend Development:
1. Implement the server-side logic using Python.
2. Set up the database connection and create necessary tables.
3. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing ships, crews, maintenance, etc.
4. Implement authentication and authorization for user management.

## Frontend Development:
1. Design and develop the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Implement forms for user input and interaction.
3. Use AJAX for asynchronous communication with the backend.

## Integration:
1. Integrate the frontend with the backend.
2. Ensure proper communication between frontend and backend components.

## Testing:
1. Write unit tests for backend components.
2. Perform manual testing of the frontend and backend functionalities.

## Deployment:
1. Deploy the application to a web server or a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
2. Set up the database in the production environment.

## Documentation:
1. Document the project, including installation instructions, usage guide, and code documentation.

Great! Based on your requirements, here's a more detailed breakdown of the functionalities and features we'll need to implement for your ship management system:
User Management:
Registration: Users can create their own accounts with a unique username.
Authentication: Users can log in securely to access the system.
Authorization: Different roles (captain, co-captain, crew) with different permissions.
Task Management:
Create Task: Captains can create tasks and assign them to crew members.
Assign Roles: Specify the role of each crew member (captain, co-captain, crew) when assigning tasks.
View Tasks: Users can see the tasks assigned to them.
Update Task Status: Users can mark tasks as completed.
Remove Task: Only captains and co-captains can remove tasks.
Database Management:
Store user accounts (username, password, role).
Store tasks (task name, description, assigned user, status).
Frontend Development:
User interface for registration, login, and task management.
Forms for creating tasks, assigning roles, and updating task status.
Display tasks assigned to each user.
Backend Development:
Implement user authentication and authorization.
Create endpoints for user registration, login, and task management.
Implement CRUD operations for tasks.
Validate user roles to ensure only captains and co-captains can perform certain actions.
Integration:
Connect the frontend and backend components to enable seamless communication.
Ensure proper validation and error handling.
Testing:
Write unit tests for backend functionality.
Perform manual testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Deployment:
Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform.
Set up the database in the production environment.
